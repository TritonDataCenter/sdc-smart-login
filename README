What is this?
-------------

Smart login is the set of components that enable SSHd on customer zones to
resolve public keys in CAPI.

The agent/client are installed along with other agents, the plugin is included
as part of dataset packaging.

A few key tidbites:

- The client is for troubleshooting/manual intervention only
- The agent assumes the OS has libzdoor and libsmartsshd laid down
- The SMF service makes zones a dependent of this package
