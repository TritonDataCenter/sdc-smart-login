What is this?
-------------

Smart login is the set of components that enable SSHd on customer zones to
resolve public keys in CAPI.

The smart-login package contains 3 key items, plus some supporting scripts and
files.  The essential pieces in here are:

* agent: the smartlogin server that runs in the GZ, listening for SSH login
   requests and forwarding them to CAPI.
* plugin: the SSHd plugin that lives in customer zones, forwarding to previously
   mentioned agent.
* client: used by provisioner to "poke" the agent whenever new customer zones
   are provisioned, such that a zdoor is opened for it.

The agent/client are installed along with other agents, the plugin is included
as part of dataset packaging.
